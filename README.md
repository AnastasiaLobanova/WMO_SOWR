# GSheet Plug In 
This tool helps to calculate discharge anomaly for a given gauge and provides you with a label, which then could be submitted to the WMO and will be used for the production of the State of the Global Water Resources Report series. You don't need to add the name of the gauge to this tool and the tool is not sharing any data with the WMO. It just calculates the label, which you can copy and together with the gauge names and its lon/lat and send by email to your contact person at the WMO.
